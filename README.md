### Movie Rating Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors. By analyzing historical movie data, the goal is to build a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

#### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques in the context of predicting movie ratings. By analyzing the factors that influence movie ratings, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately estimate the ratings of movies.

#### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various movies, including features such as:

- Title
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- Release date
- Duration
- Budget
- Gross earnings
- Production company
- Rating (target variable)

#### Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions. Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships between features and target variable.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies in the data. Encode categorical variables and perform feature scaling if necessary.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance predictive power. For example, extracting information from text fields like directors and actors, creating dummy variables for genres, etc.
4. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various regression techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, etc., to identify the best-performing model.
5. **Model Training:** Train the selected model(s) on the preprocessed dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model(s) using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), etc.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve performance.
8. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict the ratings of movies in new data.
